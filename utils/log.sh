1. check how to do detections(score maps + geometry) in text detection;

2. how features could be aggregated together better(concatenate, extras layers);
- feature-wise trasnformation;

3. Extra training on geometry regression, smart loss function, regularization;
- loss on geo individually;
- LSTM would help?

I'm very curious that the continuing training becomes worse,
